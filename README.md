# 🧩 Project Interface Design – Air Quality Monitoring Casing

This project was developed for the *User Interface Design (Perancangan Antarmuka Pengguna)* course at **Institut Teknologi Del**.  
It focuses on creating a **3D casing design** for an IoT-based air quality monitoring system using **SolidWorks**, later fabricated through **3D printing**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design an **ergonomic**, **functional**, and **aesthetic** physical interface that can house IoT components for air quality monitoring.  
The design emphasizes **usability**, **visibility**, and **comfort** for indoor environmental monitoring applications.

---

## 🧱 Design Overview
The casing was modeled using **SolidWorks 2023** and consists of:
- **Outer Metal Shell** – for protection and structure  
- **Inner PLA+ Enclosure** – for holding sensors and PCB  
- **LCD Display Window** – to visualize data readings  
- **Ventilation Slots** – to ensure airflow for accurate measurements  
- **Top Lid & Stand Legs** – for stability and easy maintenance  

📁 All design files are located in the [`/solidworks_design`](./solidworks_design) folder.

## ⚙️ Design Files
Main files include:
- `body and tutup.SLDASM` – Full assembly  
- `Casing PCB.SLDASM` – PCB casing module  
- `front pcb.SLDDRW`, `right pcb.SLDDRW`, etc. – 2D drawing sheets  
- `kaki tiang2.SLDPRT`, `tutup pcb.SLDPRT` – 3D parts

## 🖨️ 3D Printing
The model was printed using **PLA+ material** through **FDM 3D printing**.  
The result is a compact and durable prototype with accessible ports and ventilation openings.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, students learned to:
- Apply **interface design principles** to physical product design  
- Use **SolidWorks** for 3D modeling and assembly  
- Prepare 3D models for **additive manufacturing (3D printing)**  
- Balance **functionality and visual design** in hardware casings
